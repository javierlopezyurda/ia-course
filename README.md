##Book Recommender

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This AI takes the list of books a user has read as input and generates personalized book recommendations. It can consider various sources such as Goodreads, Google Books, and other online book databases to create the most relevant suggestions.

##Background

Discovering new books can be overwhelming due to the sheer volume of options available. While recommendations from friends, social media, or platforms like Goodreads exist, they often lack personalization. This AI aims to provide tailored book suggestions based on reading history, preferences, and patterns in the types of books a user enjoys.

##How is it used?

Anyone who enjoys reading can benefit from this AI. Whether someone wants a single book recommendation or a curated list for their next reading list, this AI provides tailored suggestions.

##Data sources and AI methods

Data sources include user reading history, ratings, and reviews from platforms like Goodreads and Google Books using their APIs.

The AI may consider features such as genre, author, publication year, user ratings, and thematic elements. However, the specific features and patterns are largely learned by the AI itself rather than pre-defined manually.

##Challenges

Understanding nuanced preferences such as writing style, plot complexity, or thematic depth can be difficult. Early versions of the AI may focus primarily on genres, authors, and user ratings until more sophisticated natural language processing methods are implemented.

##What next?

Future improvements could include:

Incorporating advanced NLP to analyze book descriptions and reviews for better recommendations.

Adding sentiment analysis to better capture user preferences.

Integrating with more book platforms to expand the dataset.
